This is a collection of spirals generated with increasing radius and angles to 
a factor affected by the well known Fibonacci sequence first described by 
Pingala. Each line in each spiral have unique hue and saturation, making 
rainbow like patterns.  

Controls:  

s: Save current canvas as a PNG file  
r: Restart drawing  
f: Force resizing window  
z / c: Decrease / increase delay between each spiral  
x: Turn on / off the animation (if turned off, window will only refresh when 
drawing is finished, remaining stall during the actual drawing)  

This should be pleasant to watch unfolding as well as the final drawing, and 
the collections should resemble old, primitive computer generated abstract 
drawings.  

The hue, saturation and luminance features of this token are related to he HSL 
range of the background color. The luminance affects everything that's being 
drawn. The background color has been fixed with the fxhash token to keep the 
generated animation free from epilepsy hazard. Because of that, it's likely 
that every token will be unique and equally rare.  

In this version, Fibonacci numbers are pre calculated with sympy.  

At each new variation, the source code is improved and new variations are 
made.  

The final token with all variations will be available after every single 
variation is minted. Minters of previous variations get reserve on next 
variations. Almost 90% of the royalties goes to the minters.  

The source code is available with a GNU Affero license. Feel free to remix this 
work and publish derivatives with the same license.

**NOTE:** variation 9 has been flagged as undesirable content by the moderation 
team. Reason: Variation too low. The 
[one person who minted](https://www.fxhash.xyz/u/jpsiroman) has been 
[refunded](https://tzkt.io/opVLKm9BjvC92wov4VEKsPH9nXg6UpdRkYBvrniX5soTTdqBMk1) 
and I 
[requested the token to be removed](https://discord.com/channels/900333075509149767/909070833887100988/1092588288210116639). 
This happened because I didn't realize at development time that the final art 
will always be the same (at fxpreview() call) regardless of the initial 
background.
